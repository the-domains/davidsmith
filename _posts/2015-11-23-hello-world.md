As a Cinematographer, Inventor, Entrepreneur, and Technology Nut I'm excited to embrace AI as a tool for design.  The open ended nature of TheGrid leaves me wondering where this space will lead.  I'm ready to jump down the Rabbit Hole, I just have no idea where it will lead.  For now, this will be my repository for my diverse interests and experiences.  Over time, who knows it may even get interesting.
