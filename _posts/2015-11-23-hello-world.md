As a Cinematographer, Inventor, Entrepreneur, and Technology Nut I'm excited to embrace AI as a tool for design.  The open ended nature of TheGrid leaves me wondering where this space will lead.  I'm ready to jump down the Rabbit Hole, I just have no idea where it will end up.  For now, this will be my repository for my diverse interests and experiences.  Over time, who knows it may even get interesting.
